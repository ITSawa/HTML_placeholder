# 🌟 HTML Generator 🌟

## Description
**HTML Generator** is a powerful application developed using **Vite** and **TypeScript** on the client side, along with **Express** and **TypeScript** on the server side. It provides a user-friendly interface for generating HTML code, allowing developers to quickly and efficiently create web pages.

## 📁 Project Structure
- **client/** - The client side, built with **Vite** and **TypeScript**.
- **server/** - The server side, written with **Express** and **TypeScript**.
- **nginx.conf** - The configuration file for **Nginx**.

## 🚀 Installation and Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the `client` and `server` directories, then install the dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
cd client
npm install

cd ../server
npm install
2. Build the Client Side
To build the client side of the application, run the following command:

bash

cd client
npm run build
The built files will be placed in the dist directory, ready for deployment.

3. Start the Server Side
You can start the server side using the command:

bash

cd server

4. Configure Nginx
Before launching Nginx, make sure to update the configuration in the nginx.conf file by replacing all the paths with your own. This is crucial for the application to function correctly.

Check Nginx Configuration
Before starting Nginx, check the configuration with the following command:

bash

sudo nginx -t -c ~/html_generator/nginx.conf
If the check is successful, you will see a message indicating that there are no errors in the configuration.

Start Nginx
After a successful check, start Nginx with your configuration:

bash

sudo nginx -c ~/html_generator/nginx.conf
🌐 Usage
Once the server and Nginx are running, you can access the application through your browser at: http://<your_address>:<port>. Simply enter this address in the address bar, and you will land on the application's main page.
